Built in 1929, this remarkable residence channels the spirit of a great English country home, where architecture was intentional, materials were chosen to endure, and every detail served both beauty and function.  The home was commissioned by William H. McDonnell, founder of the Southtown Economist newspaper and a prominent civic figure of his time. Its architect, Homer G. Sailor, brought a refined hand to the design, creating a residence that feels both stately and welcoming. In 2021 the home was renovated to blend that formal approach with todays modern amenities | new electrical, plumbing, drain tiles, kitchen, baths, and basement.With four bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths, the interior offers a series of gracious rooms designed for entertaining and comfortable daily life. The home's scale, symmetry, and period craftsmanship create a sense of permanence rarely  found today. Stone | Lead Glass Windows | Moldings  Set along the gently curving route of Longwood Drive, the property enjoys a setting that feels quietly removed from the city - yet it's lovingly known as the \"Village in the City\". This is a home of substance | history | and enduring presence. Make this home your next chapter. Close to Metra and Shops on 103rd. This home is located in both the Ridge and Longwood Historic Districts. SHOWINGS will be on Sunday, December 14, 2025 | 11am - 6pm.Continue Reading",
